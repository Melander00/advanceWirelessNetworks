# Lab 1 Deliverables

## Part I – Simulation (ns-3)

For each of the four propagation models (Two-Ray Ground, COST231-Hata, Friis, Nakagami):

1. **Initial distance calculation**

   * Show how you determined the initial distance *di* (the border of the transmission range) for each model.
   * Submit as `initial_distance_<model>.txt` (e.g. `initial_distance_friis.txt`).

2. **Simulation results**

   * Run experiments at 8 distances: {di, 7di/8, 6di/8, …, di/8}.
   * For each model, produce:

     * `<model>_results.csv` — columns: `distance,bitrate`.
     * `<model>_plot.png` — plot of bitrate vs. distance.

3. **Bitrate calculation evidence**

   * Provide one example Wireshark screenshot (sender & receiver PCAP) showing how you measured bitrate.
   * Submit as `<model>_wireshark.png` for any one model of your choice.

## Part II – Practical Measurement

1. **Measured RSSI values**

   * Capture RSSI at different distances in a corridor (with at least one corner, as in Fig. 3 of the lab handout).
   * Submit as `measured_rssi.csv` — columns: `distance,rssi_dbm`.

2. **Path loss calculations**

   * Compute path loss (Tx power – RSSI).
   * Submit as `measured_pathloss.csv` — columns: `distance,path_loss_db`.
   * Also compute theoretical path loss with Friis at the same distances.
   * Submit as `friis_pathloss.csv`.

3. **Plots**

   * `pathloss_comparison.png` — plot measured vs Friis path loss.

4. **Discussion**

   * In `discussion.txt`, answer: *Does the Friis model mimic the measured path loss? Why or why not?*
