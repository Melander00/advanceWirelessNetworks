| **Friis (Free Space)** | Theoretical free-space LOS model; power decays \~ **1/d²** (inverse-square law). No reflections or obstruction losses. Valid in far-field free space (d > 3λ).                                                                                                                                             | Open air, clear LOS (e.g. satellite links, rural open field, reference/baseline scenarios).                                                                                          | - Simple, foundation model derived from physics. <br/>- **Optimistic** (minimal loss) – gives upper-bound range/throughput.                                                                                                                                                          | - Not realistic with obstacles or ground reflection. <br/>- Invalid at very close range (near-field); uses a min distance to avoid singularity. <br/>- Tends to overestimate coverage in non-free-space conditions.                                                                                                |
| **Two-Ray Ground**     | LOS + **ground-reflected** path. At long distances, direct and reflected waves interfere causing \~ **1/d^4** power decay (more rapid drop after a break point). Uses Friis for short ranges to avoid rapid oscillations.                                                                                  | Terrestrial LOS with a reflecting ground plane (e.g. outdoor long-range, base station to mobile over flat terrain).                                                                  | - Captures a key real effect (ground reflection) -> more realistic range prediction than Friis for ground systems. <br/>- Simple formula, efficient to compute.                                                                                                                      | - **Not accurate <u>very</u> close** (requires switching to Friis model). <br/>- Only one reflection considered (flat earth); ignores buildings, multiple bounces. <br/>- After the break point, can be too pessimistic if environment doesn’t cause full cancellation (model assumes worst-case phase alignment). |
| **COST231 (Hata)**     | Empirical macro-cell **urban path loss** model. Path loss \~ **log-distance** with exponent \~3–4 (plus constant losses for city). Accounts for frequency (1.5–2 GHz) and antenna heights. No fast fading, just median large-scale loss.                                                                   | Cellular networks, city environments with rooftops and clutter. Suited for large cells (up to \~20 km). Also used with suburban/rural corrections for those environments.            | - **Real-world tuned**: gives realistic path loss for urban scenarios based on measurements. <br/>- Includes key factors (frequency, Tx/Rx heights) – good for assessing coverage with tower vs mobile.                                                                              | - **Limited scope**: Only validated for certain freq (≈2 GHz) and heights/distances. <br/>- Not suitable for small-scale scenarios (e.g. indoor or short-range Wi-Fi) without adjustment. <br/>- Provides only average loss – actual shadowing/fading must be added separately for realism.                        |
| **Nakagami Fading**    | Statistical **multipath fading** model. Applies a random factor to power with Nakagami-\$m\$ distribution (e.g. Rayleigh for m=1). Doesn’t impose distance attenuation itself (needs to pair with a path loss model). Can set different \$m\$ for near/mid/far ranges to emulate changing fading severity. | Any scenario requiring realistic signal variability: e.g. urban mobile networks, indoor Wi-Fi, VANETs. Especially when studying reliability or protocols under channel fluctuations. | - **Captures fast fading** effects (signal strength variability) in a simple way. <br/>- Flexible: by tuning \$m\$, can represent from mild Rician-like fading (high \$m\$) to severe Rayleigh/deeper fading (low \$m\$). <br/>- Can be combined with any path loss model (modular). | - Not a stand-alone path loss model (no distance-based mean – must combine with one). <br/>- Purely stochastic: no correlation or frequency selectivity unless added. <br/>- Adds randomness, which may require many runs to get average performance; specific outcomes can vary run-to-run.                       |
