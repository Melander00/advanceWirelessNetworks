# Lab 04 Deliverables

Place all files in `Lab-04-LTE/submission/`. Submit one archive or pull request containing:

1. **Language choice**  
   - `choice.txt` containing exactly one line:  
     ```
     C++
     ```  
     or  
     ```
     Python
     ```

2. **Trace files**  
   - `DlRlcStats.trace`  
   - `DlPdcpStats.trace`

3. **Throughput vs. Data Rate**  
   - `throughput_vs_rate.csv` — two columns:  
     ```
     data_rate_mbps,throughput_bps
     ```  
   - `throughput_vs_rate_plot.png` — DL throughput vs. application data rate.

4. **Throughput vs. Distance**  
   - `throughput_vs_distance.csv` — two columns:  
     ```
     distance_m,throughput_bps
     ```  
   - `throughput_vs_distance_plot.png` — DL throughput vs. UE distance (isotropic antenna).

**File names must match exactly.**  
- CSV files require a header row.  
- Plots must include axis labels and legends.  
- Do not include extra files or build artifacts.
